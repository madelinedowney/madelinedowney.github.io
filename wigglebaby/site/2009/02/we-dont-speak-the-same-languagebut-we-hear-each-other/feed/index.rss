		<description>Oh she is so precious! Are you using a sleep tracking sheet? Begin timing her durations and times down to the hour/minutes. As she goes through her growth spurts, they will stretch out, and you can time when she will sleep longer, thank God. Make sure to put on soft music that isn&#039;t interesting at bedtime as you are winding her down. Make it boring and an evening bath will make her sleep better. The photos are so cute - love the one with Echo the Bunny man and the commentary too!
Love, Aunt Tracy</description>
