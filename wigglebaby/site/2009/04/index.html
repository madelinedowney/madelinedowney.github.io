<p>Greetings electronic weblog viewers! An unusually long amount of time has passed since I last updated you with the sordid details of my daily routines, so I&#8217;ll just get right to it.</p>
<p>For starters, I have grown up so fast! Now staring down the barrel of my fourth month, I&#8217;ve been outgrowing clothes, diapers, chairs, swings — you name it, I probably don&#8217;t fit in it. Along with my increased size, I gained other useful skills such as holding up my own head, focusing attention on people and objects, sitting upright, and grabbing stuff with specific intentions (as opposed to my previous &#8220;coincidental intentions.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t slowed down my teething/chewing routines in the least, but I&#8217;m trying to round out those activities to achieve a well-balanced gamut of entertainment. The Big People have me going to yoga, and some other sort of facility where they all say funny things in funny voices. I&#8217;ve also enjoyed my new suite of toys at home, especially the blinky piano/noisy ones.</p>
<p>By far the most fulfilling culmination of my nascent journey into person-hood was my first experience in a Big People-level chair at the kitchen table. Finally I am no longer relegated to the bouncy seat on the ground, which was fine for a while, but now makes me feel kind of inferior. Along with the really tall chair, I have been able to explore the outdoors a bit&#8230;Grass and trees are nice, but they are rather difficult to put in my mouth, so I&#8217;m not too interested right now.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s official — I&#8217;ve turned over a new leaf! Underneath that leaf, I discovered a seemingly limitless sweetness, which has become my predominant disposition. These days, I&#8217;ll smile, play, act bashful, laugh at silly jokes (almost) and when all of that&#8217;s over, I&#8217;ll even take a decent (by comparison) nap. Some avid readers might find themselves befuddled by this news, but I can assure you that these Happy Days are not just a result of the Fonz Hair Goo I mentioned in my earlier posting. Although, heyy, it can&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>Consistency is the key, as I have been well entertained by a steady stream of Big People visitors and occasionally equal-sized people, which is exciting and hence makes me ever-so-sleepy. Also on the consistency front, I have been persuaded into maintaining a regimented schedule, despite my strong inner desire to protest this at any opportunity. Make no mistake, I intend to protest, but&#8230;yawn.</p>
<p>Not all of my stubbornness has subsided, though, as I am still adamant about keeping 1-5 fingers in my mouth during all waking hours, and preferably during most sleeping hours, if not for that pesky swaddle. Unfortunately, due to the finger obsession my eyes occasionally take a beating, since I don&#8217;t have accurate hand control at the moment and frequently whack myself unintentionally.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close the evening with some shoutouts (written, not verbal — people are sleeping!) to recent notables:</p>
<ul>
<li>occasional short walks outside, since Chicago weather improved from a miserable 30 to an inconsistent 60 degree average</li>
<li>a fun trip downtown to see my aunt Sandy</li>
<li>super fun Easter toys from my wonderful family</li>
<li>an increased interest in looking at stuff and thinking about stuff</li>
<li>wiggling</li>
<li>playing with my new light-up piano toy, which plays musical notes and also makes animal sounds for some still-undetermined reason</li>
<li>mirrors = funny</li>
<li>people making fake fart noises = funny</li>
<li>taking away my hands from my mouth = DUDE, SO NOT FUNNY, GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS</li>
</ul>

<p>I admit it, I disagree with myself. Since penning my anti-sleep manifesto last week, I suddenly turned over a new leaf&#8230;Now I will take a decent nap without fighting about it too much. My fellow residents did indeed rejoice with untempered glee; at least until The Dastardly Cat annoyed everyone within a 12-block radius, immediately bringing a return to the more common levels of vitriol.</p>
<p>The significant new event of the week is the possible upcoming protrusion of bone material in my mouth region. To mitigate this issue I have greatly increased the practices of chewing and drooling excessively, preferably simultaneously. Unfortunately for myself, I have no interest in chewing on, looking at, or being even remotely physically close to any synthetic pacification items, so for now it&#8217;s hands, fingers, thumbs, or bust!</p>
<p>Today was something called Easter, which appears to involve abundant food, pastel color explosions, and confusion. At least that was the best I could make of it. Despite all of this oddity I maintained a steady, calm demeanor, either because I really dig pastel pink, or because I was distracted by deviled eggs and noises. Jury&#8217;s still out on that one.</p>
<p>P.S. You may have noticed in the photo above that I have a new buddy named Harriet the Horse. She is soft and interesting, but don&#8217;t tell my other friend Echo the Bunny Man, because he is a jealous sort and occasionally ruffles feathers in the toy animal community.</p>

<p>These days, I like to challenge the conventional wisdom (and substantial quantities of written documentation) that suggests I should quit partying and start sleeping when I&#8217;m tired. This line of reasoning fails to address my tenacious interest in everything except napping. Some examples of things that are better than napping: looking in mirrors; being in constant motion; demanding satisfaction; the theory and practice of avoiding naps. </p>
<p>This past weekend I turned three months old, and as a reward I received a giant red talking puppet man from my grandma. The talking puppet man seems to be trying to tell me something, but I am primarily distracted by my extreme and focused concentration on nap avoidance.</p>
<p>Also during the last couple of weeks I developed a case of what the Big People call cradle cap, or in layman&#8217;s terms, some dry skin on your head. The solution to this problem is apparently to stick a bunch of oily goo on the affected area. So, I re-titled this malady &#8220;A New Opportunity to Grease My Hair To Look Like the Fonz.&#8221; Heyyy, it worked out OK!</p>
<p>Aside from that, I had several visits with lots of fun people. Given my no-sleep resolution I remained tired, but defiant.</p>
